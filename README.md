# OpenBreast
This is a Matlab implementation of different tools for processing digital mammography images developed by Universidad Industrial de Santander. The following tasks have been implemented [1]:

* Image standardization for (RAW and PROCESSED) digital mammography images
* Breast segmentation and chest wall detection
* Detection of regions on interest within the breast
* Feature extraction for parenchymal analysis

To get started first run setup.m to configure Openbreast. Then run the following demos:

* demo01		Breast segmentation
* demo02 		ST mapping
* demo03 		ROI detection
* demo04 		Feature extraction on FFDM images
